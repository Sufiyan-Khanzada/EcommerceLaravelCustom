              <p>All Firequick flares are designed to be rugged and provide high-performance, dynamic ignition capability. All flares burn at an unprecedented 4000° F, and once lit will burn even under water. They are tough and will not break up when encountering hard surface landings or impacts. With delayed ignition capability built in, these flares increase user safety in performing both control, and prescribed burn operations.</p>
              <p><strong><a href="https://fortune5.pro/page/products/category/3">Hotshot</a><br></strong>The Hotshot flare is a mechanically-launched, remote ignition flare, effective in light to medium fuels. This flare is often used in prescribed fire operations to burn off vast grassy or high weed areas. A 1-3 second delay allows placement of the flare 300-350 feet (90-107 meters) from the launch point before ignition. This flare is to be launched only and is NEVER to be ignited by hand; serious injury may occur if hand-ignition is attempted. A #6 cartridge is recommended for firing.</p>
              <p><strong><a href="https://fortune5.pro/page/products/category/3">Stubby</a><br></strong>The Stubby is a launch-only flare to be fired from the FireQuick Dual Launcher II or III and packs more fire-power and demonstrates higher energy than ever before. This flare is a great choice for remote ignition in light to medium, and even damp fuels. Launch distance is 250-350 feet (76-107meters) before ignition. This flare is to be launched only and is NEVER to be ignited by hand; serious injury may occur if hand-ignition is attempted. A #6 cartridge is recommended for firing.</p>
              <p><strong><a href="https://fortune5.pro/page/products/category/3">Chubbie</a><br></strong>The Chubbie is a lightweight, compact and extremely rugged hand-throw flare. This baseball size flare is easy to carry and easy to throw. It exhibits high-performance ignition capability in a variety of fuels and proves the perfect partner to the Stubby and Big Shot Flares.</p>
              <p><strong><a href="https://fortune5.pro/page/products/category/3">Big Shot</a><br></strong>The Big Shot is a robust, hand-throw only flare that is extremely effective in medium to heavy and wet fuels. Burning material is sprayed up to 15-25 feet (4.5-7.5 meters) for 10 seconds during initial jetting. This large and rugged flare is particularly good for tossing into deep culverts or other difficult terrain areas to safely start a fire without having to risk personnel hiking in. The Big Shot is also effective in starting fire in slash piles, high canopy vegetation, etc.</p>
              
              <p><strong><a href="https://fortune5.pro/page/products/category/3">Larger Format Flare</a><br></strong>The partner flare to the Large Format Launcher is the yellow Large-Format Flare, a mechanically launch-only flare, created to balance weight, flight and fire performance.  Firequick designed this flare in response to the need to get the higher fire power of our large flares a distance further than they can be thrown by hand. Like our other flares, it is robust and includes a delayed remote ignition, a simple and reliable design, and an added tension dot on the side of flare to keep the flare from falling easily out of the barrel if the launcher is pointed down. The large format flare can be propelled approx. 200 feet (61 meters) from the firing point or can be used to run a precise ribbon of fire across a field from a level firing position.  4000° F burning material is sprayed up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) during initial jetting.</p>
