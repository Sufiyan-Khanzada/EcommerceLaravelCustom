                   <p>Winchester or Powers Industrial Load is used in the FireQuick Lauchers for igniting and propelling the launch capable flares (Hotshot and Stubby). For optimal performance, it is recommended that the #6 (purple) be used, although we offer #5 cartridges if desired. All cartridges come in boxes of 100 each.</p>
                   
                   <h2 class="noo-sh-title-top">The Dual Launcher Holster</h2>
                   <p>This belt-ready holster accommodates the Dual Launcher II and the Dual Launcher III with or without the Hotshot barrel adapter in place. There is a convenient outer pocket on the holster to carry your barrel adapter or a box of cartridges.</p>

                   <p>This leather case can attach to any standard belt and be worn next to your FireQuick Holster. It can carry up to 4 speed loaders.</p>


                   <h2 class="noo-sh-title-top">FireQuick Flare Systems User Training Materials</h2>
                   <p>The Big Shot is a robust, hand-throw only flare that is extremely effective in medium to heavy and wet fuels. Burning material is sprayed up to 15-25 feet (4.5-7.5 meters) for 10 seconds during initial jetting. This large and rugged flare is particularly good for tossing into deep culverts or other difficult terrain areas to safely start a fire without having to risk personnel hiking in. The Big Shot is also effective in starting fire in slash piles, high canopy vegetation, etc.</p>

                   <h2 class="noo-sh-title-top">Larger Format Flare</h2>
                   <p>Firequick Products offers a comprehensive User Training Workbook available as a hardcopy or a digital download. This workbook covers the flare and launcher specifications, field applications, field care and safety considerations, transportation, storage and handling recommendations and security concerns, as well as troubleshooting and disposal techniques. The workbook does not attempt to dictate firing or burn operation procedures, but is limited specifically to the product line use and safety. This workbook has been utilized successfully to support formal and informal firing operations training events.

                    The hardcopy workbook is illustrated in color and comes in a soft protective report cover.
                    
                    The digital download is available as a .pdf and will be sent to your email upon confirmation of payment. It contains all sections of the workbook and can be used to print one or more workbooks for your crew or class.</p>
