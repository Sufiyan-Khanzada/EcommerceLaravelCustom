Winchester or Powers Industrial Load is used in the FireQuick Lauchers for igniting and propelling the launch capable flares (Hotshot and Stubby). For optimal performance, it is recommended that the #6 (purple) be used, although we offer #5 cartridges if desired. All cartridges come in boxes of 100 each.

Firequick Products offers a comprehensive User Training Workbook available as a hardcopy or a digital download. This workbook covers the flare and launcher specifications, field applications, field care and safety considerations, transportation, storage and handling recommendations and security concerns, as well as troubleshooting and disposal techniques. The workbook does not attempt to dictate firing or burn operation procedures, but is limited specifically to the product line use and safety. This workbook has been utilized successfully to support formal and informal firing operations training events.

<p>
The hardcopy workbook is illustrated in color and comes in a soft protective report cover.

The digital download is available as a .pdf and will be sent to your email upon confirmation of payment. It contains all sections of the workbook and can be used to print one or more workbooks for your crew or class.
