                                        <p>Following months of research, development and extensive testing, Firequick Products has released its latest flare design to production. The new flare has been configured as the ideal companion to Firequick’s new Large Format Launcher coming to the market soon. Firequick employed considerable user input to develop this new flare in order to accomplish the specific performance requirements desired. The flare can be propelled up to 300’ using the new launcher which is much further than a large flare can be thrown by hand. It has ample fire power and jetting distance to light up even the most difficult fuels and comes with the same great 95% ignition rate guarantee that all Firequick flares offer. Follow us on Facebook and Instagram to be the first to know about availability of the flare as we ready it for market!</p>
